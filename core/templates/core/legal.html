            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 16, 2025</p>

            <p>This privacy policy applies to the SightTrack app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile
                devices that was created by SightTrack (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service.
                This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

            <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
            <p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include
                information such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
                <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on
                    those pages</li>
                <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
                <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="highlight">The Application does not gather precise information about the location of
                    your mobile device.</span></p>

            <p>The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide
                you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.</p>

            <p>For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide
                us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that the Service Provider
                request will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>Third Party Access</h3>
            <p>Only <span class="highlight">aggregated, anonymized data</span> is periodically transmitted to
                external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The
                Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in
                this privacy statement.</p>

            <p>The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>
                <li>when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect
                    your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request</li>
                <li>with their trusted services providers who work on their behalf, do not have an independent use
                    of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this
                    privacy statement</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Opt-Out Rights</h3>
            <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by <span
                    class="highlight">uninstalling it</span>. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be
                available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

            <h3>Data Retention Policy</h3>
            <p>The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a
                reasonable time thereafter. If you'd like them to delete User Provided Data that you have provided
                via the Application, please contact them at <span class="highlight">contact@sighttrack.com</span>
                and they will respond in a reasonable time.
            </p>

            <h3>Children</h3>
            <p>The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to <span
                    class="highlight">children under the age of 13</span>.</p>

            <p>The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.
                The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information
                through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians
                to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their
                children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or
                Services without their permission.</p>

            <p>If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the
                Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider at
                <span class="highlight">contact@sighttrack.com</span> so that they will be able to take the
                necessary actions. You must also be at least <span class="highlight">16 years of age</span> to
                consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some
                countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
            </p>

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The
                Service Provider provides <span class="highlight">physical, electronic, and procedural
                    safeguards</span> to protect information the Service Provider processes and maintains.</p>

            <h3>Changes</h3>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify
                you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are
                advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed
                approval of all changes.</p>

            <h3>Your Consent</h3>

            <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in
                order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and
                access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against <span
                    class="highlight">jailbreaking or rooting your phone</span>, which involves removing software
                restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions
                could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security
                features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.</p>

            <h3>Internet Connectivity</h3>
            <p>Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some
                functions of the Application require an <span class="highlight">active internet connection</span>,
                which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held
                responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or
                if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p>

            <h3>Data Usage and Charges</h3>
            <p>If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network
                provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile
                provider for data usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By
                using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including <span
                    class="highlight">roaming data charges</span> if you use the application outside of your home
                territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer
                for the device on which you are using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission
                from the bill payer.</p>

            <h3>User Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the
                application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If
                your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider
                cannot be held responsible.</p>

            <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to
                note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on
                third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service
                Provider <span class="highlight">accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect</span>, that
                you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the application.</p>

            <h3>Application Updates and Termination</h3>
            <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently
                available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they
                decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download
                the updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee
                that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the
                particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to <span
                    class="highlight">always accept updates</span> to the application when offered to you.</p>

            <p>The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its use at
                any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any
                termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease
                using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.</p>

            <h3>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h3>
            <p>The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised
                to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes
                by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>
